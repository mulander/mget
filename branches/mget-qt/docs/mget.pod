mget - download videos off video hosting sites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

mget [options...] [url]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Movie Get aims to be a simple console script allowing a user to download embeded movies from various video hosting services. It uses common *nix programs to download the file and convert it from flv to mpg format. The main work of mget is to get the direct video link, which it achieves with the help of the great ruby programming language.

=head1 EXAMPLES

B<mget -cr url>
  Will download the video from the url, convert it and remove the leftover file without prompting the user on each step.

B<mget -dC url>
  Will download the movie, but will not attempt to convert it. Again the user will not be prompted.

B<mget -n cool_movie url>
  Will ask the user to download the movie or not. Will ask to convert the movie or not (if the movie is convertable). Will ask if it should remove the leftover files (if conversion occured). And will save the movie as cool_movie.extension where extension is determined automatically by the script.

B<mget -cr -i file>
  The script will read movie links from the file line by line. It will download each movie, convert it if the movie is convertable and remove the leftover file. The downloaded files will be stored in sub-directories.

B<mget -sD url>
  Will display a direct link that can be pasted into a browser and quit.
